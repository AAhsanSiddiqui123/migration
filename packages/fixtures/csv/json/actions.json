According to The Guardian, these projects will include developing rooftop gardens, ponds, filtration pools, and wetlands, with permeable roads and public spaces designed to soak rainwater back into the ground.”\n\n[Read on](https://ahbelab.com/2016/01/27/should-los-angeles-transform-itself-into-a-sponge-city/)",

    "description": "## Planning\nThere are many factors that go into planting a yard tree, so we encourage you to consider all the right conditions for your particular species.\n\n“Right tree” means the species and full-grown size of the tree is best suited for your home and the area you have available to plant the tree. You can reference our Yard Tree List [here](https://www.cityplants.org/yard-tree-species-list/) to determine how tall your new tree will grow and how the species will mature over time. Keep the full-grown size of your tree in mind when finding its spot.\n\n“Right place” means the tree has enough space to grow to its full, mature height, and its root system has the space it needs to grow fully without interfering with surrounding infrastructure or underground pipes or utility lines. Don’t forget to plant to the west or east of your building to help reduce your energy bills and save energy!\n\n## Where Should I Plant My Yard Tree?\nIt’s best to plant trees a minimum of 15 – 20 feet away from your foundation, to the west, southwest, or east side of your building. \n\nYou can call 811 at least two days before you plant to make sure you won’t run into any gas or utility lines while planting — they’ll come out for free to inspect for you!\n\nIf you plant multiple trees, make sure to space them far enough apart. Large trees should be planted at least 30 feet apart. \n\nTrees throw major shade! As days get hotter and hotter, trees act as natural air conditioners. \n\nWest is best for energy savings, as the trees will shade your home in the hot afternoon sun and save you $$ on your energy bills!\n\nPlanting trees on the east side of your home helps shade it from the morning sun (and some energy savings), but planting to the north will not provide much shade at all. \n\nVideo [City Plants #1: Planta Un Árbol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmBzWd0UKHI)",

DIG: Dig a hole at least twice the width of the tree’s container and just as deep as the soil in the pot. You can use your shovel as a measuring stick!\n\n2. PLACE TREE: \n* Remove the tree from the pot. Avoid damaging the root ball. \n* \"Massage” or loosen the roots gently to open them up,  so that they can grow outward and get off to a good start. If there are any large “circling” roots, cut them, as they can actually strangle your new tree. \n* Drop the mycorrhizal tablets in the hole (that came with your tree)\n* Place the tree in the hole. \n\n3. BACKFILL: \n* Refill the hole with soil. Make sure the top of the root ball (where the trunk meets the roots and flares out) is 1 to 2 inches ABOVE the surrounding soil level (if a root ball is below soil level, your tree may die). \n* Lightly poke the soil around the root ball to eliminate all air pockets. \n* Be careful not to pile soil on top of the root ball or against the root flare. You want to keep your root flare exposed so it can breathe!  \n* Using native soil is great, as it helps the tree adapt to its new environment. Skip the fertilizer, soil amendment, or potting soil!\n\n4. BUILD A BERM: \n* Form the remaining soil into a berm or a “moat” around the tree. \n* It should look like a donut of soil around the tree, which will ensure that water sinks directly into the tree’s roots.",

    "description": "## What\nFor your tree(s) to survive their first few years of life, they need what we call deep watering, to establish their root systems. Deep watering is the practice of slowly trickling 10-15 gallons of water into the watering basin around the base of a tree. Sprinklers will not sufficiently water young trees. While they are good for grass, we want water to filter deep into the soil around the tree to encourage the roots to grow deeply. \n\nAs a rule of thumb, your tree(s) need 10-15 gallons a week, but during the warmer months, when temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit, you will need to water your trees more frequently. Read on for important tips and tricks!\n\n## How\nFill a 5-gallon bucket of water and gently pour into the tree berm 2-3 times. You can also put a hose on a slow trickle for 1-2 hours. Make sure to water the soil around the tree — not the trunk or the leaves, which can kill your young tree!\n\nHow to care for young trees [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWVOLK7G2m4)\n\n## When should you water your tree?\nWater early in the morning or after sunset, when the sun won’t evaporate water as readily.\n\n1ST & 2ND YEAR: Deep water your shade tree once a week with 10-15 gallons. Water your fruit tree 17-20 gallons once a week. During warmer months, you may need to water your tree(s) more frequently. \n\n3RD YEAR: Deep water every 4-6 weeks during the year, water a little more during the summer. Continue to check the soil for its moisture level if you’re not certain whether or not the tree needs water.\n\nSave Your Trees From Drought [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiHmGdUP8hQ)\n\n## TIPS:\nTip 1: If you are ever unsure if you need to water, check the soil! Try this out:\n* Dig 2 - 3 inches into the soil around the root ball of your tree and grab a handful of soil.\n* Squeeze the soil into a ball. \n* If the soil crumbles, your tree needs more water! \n* If the soil sticks together, your tree has enough moisture. It’s important not to overwater a tree too, because roots need oxygen, just like we do, and when they are too submerged in water, they are not able to breathe. \n\nTip 2: A newly planted tree uses the same amount of water as a 5-minute shower each week — Not too much at all! Collect excess water from your shower in a bucket and use it to water your new tree.\n\nTip 4: Rainwater is precious here. Consider collecting rainwater to water your new tree when seasons permit.\n\nTip 5: If you water your tree with a hose, time how long it takes to fill a 5-gallon bucket with the hose set on a slow trickle, multiply that by 2-3 times. That is the time you will let your hose run when watering your tree. Make sure that the water does not escape the berm, but stays inside the tree well and soaks deep down into the roots.\n\nReminder: Trees are like natural air conditioners. The 5-gallon trees you planted will not yield immediate shade. However, planting trees when they are young allows them to establish themselves early, and if planted correctly, they will grow vigorously and eventually help cool both you and your home.\n",

In the United States, cotton ranks third after corn and soybeans as the crop that requires the most pesticides in its production. In 2019, more than 68 million pounds of pesticide were applied to cotton fields across the U.S. alone. Additionally, most conventional cotton farmers plant genetically engineered seed, resulting in higher chemical application and the engineering of more robust products that have known environmental and human health impacts. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in the widely used herbicide Roundup, made up more than one third of all pesticide use on cotton in 2019 according to the USDA.\n\n“We wanted to do something that would look a little bit deeper and incorporate farmer and processor experiences in addition to the more academic knowledge that we have about the environmental impacts of organic cotton,” Shade notes. She says a lot of growers commented on perceivable improvements in things like soil quality and increased biodiversity on their farms since transitioning to organic.\n\n[Read on](https://civileats.com/2021/03/15/what-will-it-take-for-farmers-to-grow-more-organic-cotton/)",

Luckily, barn owls have a high tolerance for humans and often choose to nest in proximity to us, making perfect neighbors even in an urban setting. \nAbout Barn Owls\nBarn owls are one of three species of owls native to Los Angeles.\n\nBarn owls are a permanent source of rodent control without pesticides or chemicals.\n\nSince the largest prey a barn owl can capture is a rodent, they are not a threat to pets.\n\nThe more barn owl boxes we place in a community, the greater the odds are that the owls will find and nest in them. Second and third generation owls will then return to the nests.\n\nBarn owls can lay two clutches of owlets a year.\nGetting Ready for Your Box\nFirst, we ask you to visit your closest neighbors and tell them you will be hosting a Barn Owl Nesting Box. We suggest that you download our Barn Owl Box Program flyers to educate them about the effects of rodenticide and the role that a Barn Owl will play in controlling the rodent population if it nests in your neighborhood. We recommend that a neighborhood become poison-free for at least three months before installing a nesting box. This will prevent your owl from succumbing to secondary rodenticide poisoning.\n\nNesting box orders are placed in the CLAW Shop section of the website, and 50% of your order is considered a tax deductible donation. Once ordered, our volunteers will promptly begin the process of crafting your box. \n\nWe provide instructions that show how you or a handyman can mount the box, how to care for the box, and 10 program flyers to distribute to neighbors.\n\nA Barn Owl's nesting season is at least once a year, sometimes twice. The rest of the year, the owls will stay in the area but won't need a box.\n\nRodents, Poison and You\n\nOwls alone might not solve your rodent problem, but please don't use poison.  Traditional rat traps, electric zappers or an abatement specialist can be very effective without poisoning other wildlife.  \n\n[Learn more here](http://www.clawonline.org/barn-owls-nesting-project)\n[Purchase](http://www.clawonline.org/shop/)\n\n",

As extreme heat days become more frequent in the San Fernando Valley, it is especially important to incorporate designs that will decrease the urban heat island effect and improve the lives of Angelenos. \n\n[Learn more](https://www.climateresolve.org/canoga-park/)",

    "description": "## What\nElectric bikes belong in a category of their own because they’re more than just a fun tech fad. They could actually be the future of transportation.\n\n## PEDAL POWER BOOST\nOf course, e-bikes aren’t new or without controversy. Some feel threatened by the rising popularity of e-bikes, as though standard bikes will suddenly vanish like the penny-farthing once everyone goes electric. Rest assured: e-bikes won’t make human-powered mobility obsolete. They may actually enhance it.\n\n\n## THE TIME IS NOW\nThat said, there’s really no better time than right now to start shopping for an electric bike. The market is flooded with battery-powered bikes of all shapes and sizes. Boutique upstarts are jockeying for funding on Indiegogo and Kickstarter, while a handful of European companies are pushing the envelope with a variety of high-tech designs. Meanwhile, major bike manufacturers are finally waking up to the profit potential of e-bikes and are introducing their own lineups. Prices are fluctuating, but you can get a solidly built, reliable e-bike for less than $1,000.\n\n\n## HOW E BIKES WILL TRANSFORM TRANSPORTATION\nE-bikes lower the barriers to biking, making it easier for people who are older or more anxious about the stresses and strains of biking to justify riding. You’re more likely to ditch your car or delete your Uber app if you know you can get to where you’re going faster and more efficiently without getting overly tired or sweaty.\n\nMore importantly, e-bikes can rescue cities from the clutches of car culture. As noted by Curbed’s Alissa Walker:\n\nA 2018 study by the National Institute for Transportation and Communities that surveyed 1,800 e-bike riders found that they bike more often, take longer trips, and make different types of trips than they do on pedal bikes.\n\nNot only did more respondents feel safer riding an e-bike than they did riding a pedal bike, the percentage of people who felt safer on an e-bike was even greater when the respondents were women, over 55, or had physical limitations.\n\n“E-bikes are making it possible for more people to ride a bicycle” reads the study, “many of whom are incapable of riding a standard bicycle or don’t feel safe doing so.”\n\nIf you’re worried that electric power will take all the fun and recreation out of biking, well, you’re wrong. Another study looked at the cognitive and psychological effects of outdoor cycling and found equal results for traditional bikes and e-bikes. Climate change got you down? E-bikes are more sustainable than electric cars, and they will help clear up traffic congestion and make cities more livable. Besides, you can always shut off the motor if you’re looking for a little exercise.\n\nAs cities become more congested, some businesses are turning to e-bikes to make their deliveries. Domino’s is using Rad Power Bikes to deliver pizza in a couple of cities. UPS is using cargo bikes in Seattle. German delivery company DPD wants to use these cute mini-trucks that are actually e-bikes in disguise. In New York City, e-bikes are almost exclusively used by food delivery workers.\n\nDon’t be fooled: the US is still far behind the rest of the world when it comes to bikes. We see them more as recreational vehicle than as a transportation alternative, something you use in fair weather, not in the rain and snow like the Dutch. But come on, the US women’s national soccer team beat the Netherlands in the World Cup, so surely we can compete in the saddle as well?\n\nStreets in the US are designed for cars, and bikes and pedestrians are often just an afterthought. This marginalization has caused a shameful spike in cyclist and pedestrian deaths nationwide. E-bikes won’t reverse that trend unless enough people stop driving and start pedaling. Only then will cities find themselves confronted with the choice between maintaining the status quo or redesigning their streets to be more livable, walkable, and bikeable.\n\nElectric bikes can make getting around so much easier for everyone, including older people and people with different abilities. Look, everything is terrible, and obviously, e-bikes won’t solve anything unless more people start riding. But there is one thing I can promise you: once you start riding, you won’t want to stop.\n\n[Read more here](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20904414/electric-bikes-ebike-guide-rideables-battery-how-to-buy-price)",

Proper tree mulching helps trees retain water, combat weeds and regulate soil temperature. Below, we answer the most common questions about how to apply mulch to trees.  \n\n## How\nThe key is to let nature be your guide. Trees in a natural setting aren’t covered up to their trunks. A rule of thumb is to keep the trees’ root flare—the spot where the tree trunk ends and the roots begin—free of mulch.\n\nVolcano mulching, or piling mulch up against the trunk or stem of a tree, creates a cool, damp hideaway that attracts fungus, disease and pests.\n\n## How much mulch should I apply to my trees?\n2 to 4 inches of mulch layered around the base of your tree is all you need.\n\nFirst, spread the mulch around your tree, then use a rake or shovel to evenly pull the mulch out to the furthest edges of the tree’s canopy.\n",

The independent third-party RD performs  a baseline assessment. With this information, Eat REAL supports the school district to create an action plan.\n\nWe recognize that districts require time to make adjustments to menus, sourcing, and, in some cases, facilities and equipment, needed for increased scratch cooking and adapted procurement. This initial undertaking can span a year or more. The partnership continues as school districts  continue to make improvements and seek higher levels of certification.\n\n## How to get your district certified?\n\nFill out the certification form as a community member and wait to hear back from the Eat Real team about next steps. \n\n[Sign up](https://eatreal.org/getcertified/)",

Many human endeavors – conventional farming chief among them – have depleted the Earth to the extent that nutrient levels in almost every kind of food have fallen by between 10 and 100 percent in the past 70 years. Soil quality can improve dramatically, though, when farmers and gardeners maintain constant ground cover, increase microbe populations, encourage biological diversity, reduce the use of agricultural chemicals, and avoid tillage.\n\nSoil restoration begins with photosynthesis. \n\n[Read More](https://www.ecofarmingdaily.com/build-soil/soil-restoration-5-core-principles/)",

    "description": "## What\nTrees and other plants help cool the environment, making vegetation a simple and effective way to reduce urban heat islands.\nTrees and vegetation lower surface and air temperatures by providing shade and through evapotranspiration. Shaded surfaces, for example, may be 20–45°F (11–25°C) cooler than the peak temperatures of unshaded materials.1 Evapotranspiration, alone or in combination with shading, can help reduce peak summer temperatures by 2–9°F (1–5°C).\n\nTrees and vegetation are most useful as a mitigation strategy when planted in strategic locations around buildings or to shade pavement in parking lots and on streets. Researchers have found that planting deciduous trees or vines to the west is typically most effective for cooling a building, especially if they shade windows and part of the building’s roof.\n\n## Benefits and Costs\nThe use of trees and vegetation in the urban environment brings benefits beyond mitigating urban heat islands including:\n\nReduced energy use: Trees and vegetation that directly shade buildings decrease demand for air conditioning.\nImproved air quality and lower greenhouse gas emissions: By reducing energy demand, trees and vegetation decrease the production of associated air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. They also remove air pollutants and store and sequester carbon dioxide.\n\nEnhanced stormwater management and water quality: Vegetation reduces runoff and improves water quality by absorbing and filtering rainwater.\n\nReduced pavement maintenance: Tree shade can slow deterioration of street pavement, decreasing the amount of maintenance needed.\n\nImproved quality of life: Trees and vegetation provide aesthetic value, habitat for many species, and can reduce noise.\n\nThe primary costs associated with planting and maintaining trees or other vegetation include purchasing materials, initial planting, and ongoing maintenance activities such as pruning, pest and disease control, and irrigation.\n\nA study of urban forestry programs in five U.S. cities showed a range of expenditures: annual costs ranged from almost $15 per tree in the Desert Southwest region to $65 per tree in Berkeley, California. Pruning was often the greatest expenditure, accounting for roughly 25–40% of total annual costs (approximately $4–$20/tree). Administration and inspection costs were the next largest expenditure, ranging from approximately 8–35% of annual expenditures (about $4–$6/tree). Tree planting, surprisingly, accounted for just 2–15% of total annual urban forestry expenditures (roughly $0.50–$4/tree) in these cities.\n\nAlthough the benefits of urban forestry can vary considerably by community and tree species, they are almost always higher than the costs. The five-city study discussed above found that, on a per-tree basis, the cities accrued benefits ranging from about $1.50–$3.00 for every dollar invested. These cities spent roughly $15–$65 annually per tree, with net annual benefits ranging from approximately $30–$90 per tree.\n\n[For More Information](https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-trees-and-vegetation-reduce-heat-islands).",

    "description": "## What\nIf you bike down a street on the edge of Los Angeles’s Echo Park neighborhood, you’ll see a sudden change in the pavement on one block, where the black asphalt shifts to white. A little over a year ago, the city covered the street with a special coating—light in color, so it reflects the sun—as part of a plan to help cool L.A. as the world keeps getting hotter.\n\nLike most cities, L.A. is facing more frequent and extreme heat waves. One new study that mapped out rising heat across the country found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current path, the average number of days in a year across the U.S. that feel hotter than 100 degrees will more than double by the middle of the century. Some cities will have it worst: In Miami, by the end of the century, 153 days each year could feel that hot. Globally, cities that were relatively cool in the past are beginning to grapple with buildings that weren’t built for heat (like Berlin, where the average high in June is 72 degrees, but climbed to 101 degrees one day last month, the hottest June on record for the planet). Cities also suffer from the urban heat island effect: Hot temperatures get even hotter as pavement and buildings soak up and release radiation from the sun.\n\nThere are several ways cities can prepare for extreme heat, from changes in infrastructure—like solar and battery “microgrids” that can keep air conditioning on at cooling centers if the heat takes the grid down—to shifts to different cooling technology, like geothermal power. But three solutions are both particularly simple and particularly helpful. “We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” says Matt Petersen, president and CEO of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator and the former chief sustainability officer for the City of L.A. “That’s job number one, for long-term benefit to reduce the most extreme heat from happening. But now that extreme heat is here, we need to make sure we put in place strategies to reduce the new normal of extreme urban heat through cool streets, cool roofs, and robust urban tree canopy.”\n\n[Read more](https://www.fastcompany.com/90379081/cities-are-getting-hotter-but-we-can-redesign-them-to-keep-us-cool)",

We now know that’s not true—this year’s snowpack is at 5 percent of normal. The shift that needs to occur is moving LA’s primary source of water from imported snowmelt to captured stormwater, says Hadley. \n\n[Read on](https://gizmodo.com/heres-a-highly-rational-totally-plausible-fix-for-drou-1713918502)",

It may be discarded in the growing, harvesting or preservation phases, as happens in poorer countries, or it may be thrown out, as especially happens in richer countries, by inattentive consumers and shop owners who don’t keep the still-edible surplus. This enormous quantity of food (nearly 1.3 billion tonnes per year according to WWF estimates) is four times that needed to feed the 800 million people currently living in a state of malnutrition. \n\nWasted food has an impact on the environment in all phases of its lifecycle, each of which leaves a deep environmental “footprint” in terms of water, soil and greenhouse gas emissions. ReFED, an American coalition working to stop food waste, estimates that cutting discarded food in the United States by 20% could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18 million tonnes in ten years. \n\n[Hints and tips here](https://www.greenamerica.org/tackling-food-waste/expiration-dates-dont-mean-what-you-think)",

But Amanda Stiles and Beth Zotter want to see seaweed dominate the alt-protein supply chain and change how we eat for good. “Our goal is to develop the most sustainable supply chain for protein on Earth,” says Zotter, who cofounded the seaweed start-up Trophic with Stiles, a biochemist and former head of research at Ripple Foods, in 2018 after a stint in biofuels.\n\n[Read on](https://grist.org/fix/this-startup-says-seaweed-is-the-secret-to-a-better-faux-burger-and-a-healthier-climate/)",

The river was one of the selling points in the city’s winning bid for the 2028 Olympics. Developers are still clamoring to build along the river’s banks.\n\nThe last time the LA River was reborn it was the late 1930s, and it had been drowning the young city periodically since its birth. At some points, the river was just a trickle; in other parts, it was uncontrollably wild, and flooded frequently and devastatingly.\n\nOne photographer painstakingly reshot old photos of the once-volatile waterway. \n\nWhen the L.A. River Master Plan is released to the public, you can provide comments about the changes you would like to see in the watershed. The Flows Plan has not been released yet, but the public will have the opportunity to comment when it is released. As plans are implemented, you will have the opportunity to weigh in on each individual project that gets implemented. We recommend tracking these projects on the L.A. River Master Plan, Lower L.A. River Master Plan, ULART Plan, LARRMP, and L.A. River Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Study websites.\n\n[Read on](https://la.curbed.com/2015/8/19/9936922/la-river-history-before-concrete-after-photos)\n",

As is common in California, our house is wood-framed and has a flat, wood-and-tar roof. There’s no insulation in the walls or the roof (there is no attic space), and the long front of the house is floor-to-ceiling glass. Which sounds nice, but it sucks heat out of the house in winter and traps heat in the summer. In short, it couldn’t be less energy efficient.\n\nMany tenants are in the same position. But in Europe, where a high percentage of citizens rent rather than own, there’s far more incentive for the private and public sector to create zero-carbon housing stock. \n\n[Read on](https://hothouse.substack.com/p/to-fix-the-climate-retrofit-your)",

Using compelling graphics and visuals, along with striking NASA and NOAA footage, the film artfully illustrates how, by drawing down atmospheric carbon, soil is the missing piece of the climate puzzle.\n\nCheck out the trailer.

Buildings and asphalt absorb and radiate heat, raising summer temperatures by as much as 19 degrees in some parts of the region. According to CalEPA, LA has the worst urban heat island effect of any region in California.\n\nExcessive heat is deadly. Heat stroke, heat exhaustion, difficulty breathing, cramping and general discomfort killed more people between 1979 and 2003 than hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods and earthquakes combined, according to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. \n\nThe number of extremely hot days is expected to triple by mid-century. That’s why LA Mayor Eric Garcetti has the goal of lowering this urban heat island effect three degrees by 2035. \n\nCan the city do it? \n\n[Read more](https://www.scpr.org/news/2017/07/10/73657/roofs-streets-and-trees-how-la-is-trying-to-lower/)",

These hubs are available for food scrap drop off, compost education and hands on learning. There is no cost or requirement to join other than receiving the proper instructions from LA Compost and being a mindful and respectful steward of the space. Finished compost created at Community Compost Hubs will not be available for members to take home, it will be used onsite to create healthy soils and grow food. \n\n\n## STEP 2: COLLECT\nThe fun part! Collect your household food scraps at home making sure you’re following the compost hub guidelines. Visit the Compost FAQs page if you have any questions. Once you’re ready to drop off, visit your hub, weigh, record, and drop your scraps in the open bin. \n\n## STEP 3:  SUPPORT YOUR HUB\nEach hub is a unique community ecosystem. Your individual hub will operate on its own calendar of volunteer events and compost pile turning days. When you join a hub you’ll receive info on how to best support your compost hub in addition to providing food scraps. You can also follow @lacompost on social media to stay up to date on special hub events.\n\n[Find a hub here](https://www.lacompost.org/communityhub)",

    "description": "## What\n\nLA Compost began in 2013 with the collective efforts of volunteers, friends and family. We wanted communities to see how far their organic material was traveling and the harmful effects it had on the environment. In the beginning, our collection crew rode bikes with trailers that allowed them to haul food scraps, leaves, paper, and other organic material from restaurants, homes, and schools to local compost centers. While this model has worked in other cities, LA’s sprawl made the pilot unsustainable.\n\nIn 2014, LA Compost shifted to a model of decentralized community compost hubs -cared for, maintained and enjoyed by activated community members. LA Compost hubs are built in places where people coexist -in churches, schools, gardens, and workplaces. We now have community compost hubs throughout LA County. Each hub reflects the community in which it's located, but they all serve the same purpose. They compost organics locally while creating shared spaces for people to connect with each other and the natural world.\n\nIn 2018, we defined our scope according to the Hierarchy to Reduce Food Waste and Grow Community established by the Institute of Local Self Reliance. Our programs serve the individual for home composting, the community with access and education to a decentralized network of composting infrastrucutre, as well as regionally based sites for organics processing, compost creation, and continued education.\n\n**Get Your LA Compost Guide** \n\nAll of our compost best practices in one easy to ready guide. \n\n[Check it out!](https://www.lacompost.org/compost-guide)",

    "description": "## What\n\nThe latest innovation in sprinkler technology are nozzles that turn a standard pop-up spray head into a precision device that can save water in your landscape. In addition, water jetting from these nozzles is more resistant to wind, less\nlikely to mist, and significantly reduces run-off onto streets and sidewalks. \n\nThese nozzles shoot multi-trajectory, rotating streams that apply water more slowly and uniformly than conventional sprays and heads especially when adjusted for specific site\nconditions. Rotating nozzles use less water than traditional spray heads because they operate with lower precipitation rates and have greater distribution uniformity. In many cases, you can update your existing sprinkler heads with new rotary nozzles without having to replace the entire sprinkler body. Also, rotating nozzles have greater coverage.

Lawnmowers to maintain them account for some 5 percent of the nation’s air pollution – probably more in urban areas. Each year more than 17 million gallons of fuel are spilled during the refilling of lawn and garden equipment—more than the oil that the Exxon Valdez spilled.\n\nHomeowners spend billions of dollars and typically use 10 times the amount of pesticide and fertilizers per acre on their lawns as farmers do on crops; the majority of these chemicals are wasted due to inappropriate timing and application. These chemicals then runoff and become a major source of water pollution.Last but not least, 30 to 60 percent of urban fresh water is used on lawns. Most of this water is also wasted due to poor timing and application.

Please sign up to express your interest in volunteering when community engagement with the program resumes.  \n\nCWW volunteers must be at least 18 years of age to volunteer.\n\n[Sign up](https://www.lawaterkeeper.org/community-water-watch-sign-up)\n",

    "description": "## What\nWant a free tree for your yard or neighborhood? L.A.’s Green New Deal to plant 90,000 trees in the city over the next two years is a bonus for residents. The city will give out up to seven free yard and/or street trees to qualifying residents. More than two dozen species are listed on the city’s website, with information about their projected height and defining characteristics. Most are drought-tolerant.\n\nSmall trees include crape myrtles, which can grow to a height of 25 feet and have pink, red or white flowers. Medium trees include silk floss trees, which can reach 25 to 35 feet in height and have pink flowers; evergreen olive trees; and jacarandas, with their mesmerizing blue or lavender flowers. Jacarandas can grow to 50 feet high. Large trees, some of which can reach 80 feet tall, include coast live oaks, which are native to parts of L.A.; Canary Island, Italian stone and African fern pines; and deodar cedars, native to the Himalayas.\n\n“A family can sit at their computer in their PJs, pick out a tree online and have it delivered to their yard,” said L.A.'s first forest officer, Rachel Malarich. “All the work is done for them up to the actual planting. But don’t worry. The trees come with stakes, ties and fertilizer pellets, along with easy-to-follow instructions on how to plant them.”Neighbors can get together and request free trees for their street on the City Plants website. “One of our nonprofit partners will come and assess the location,” Malarich said. “If it meets our criteria — enough space between the sidewalk and the road; no low overhead power lines — they will obtain the necessary city permits and plant the trees for them. The neighbors must sign an agreement to water them for at least the first five years.”\n\nResidents who qualify for yard trees must also sign a commitment to water them. The first five years of a tree’s life are the most important. “If you don’t check once a week, the tree could either die or get stressed out and stop growing,” Malarich said. “If you get it past that point, you can slow down on the watering and enjoy your relationship to a living thing as you watch it grow.”\n\nMalarich advises residents to check their tree once a week. “Before you start your weekend, or when you take out the trash, stick your finger in the soil and see if it’s moist 4 inches down,” she said. “If it’s dry, give it 10 to 15 gallons of water; if it’s moist, wait until next week. You can kill a baby tree by over-watering it.”\n\n“Think of a tree as a baby,” Long Beach City College horticulture professor Jorge Ochoa said. “You need to feed it and invest time in training it to be the best it can be. If your baby grows up healthily, it will give you the pleasure and satisfaction of shade and beauty for many years.”\n\n[Read more](https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2019-11-22/los-angeles-is-giving-out-free-trees-for-yards-and-streets)",

She enjoys sitting on her porch, especially to watch the sunrise. She has always been a morning person.\n\nBut as the day progresses, the heat can be unbearable for her. On summer days like this, when highs reach into the 90s, the lack of trees in her neighborhood is hard for Haigler to ignore.\n\n\"That's what I'm accustomed to trees doing: They bring comfort. You don't notice it, you don't think about it. But they bring comfort to you,\" she says.\n\nThe tree cover in her neighborhood, Park DuValle, is about half the city average. As one of the lower-income areas of Louisville, it's in line with a citywide trend: Wealthier areas of the city have up to twice as many trees as do poorer areas.\n\nTrees can play a huge role in the health of people living in cities, but across the country, cities are losing millions of trees year after year. And many poor urban neighborhoods — often home to a city's most vulnerable — are starting at a disadvantage. \n\n[Read more](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/04/755349748/trees-are-key-to-fighting-urban-heat-but-cities-keep-losing-them).\n",

Apart from producing alcoholic beverages, agaves are often considered a plant and livestock pest, along with its thorny, nitrogen-fixing, leguminous companion trees or shrubs such as mesquite and acacias.\n\nBut now, the development of a new agave-based agroforestry and holistic livestock management system in the semi-arid drylands of Guanajuato, Mexico, utilizing basic ecosystem restorations techniques, permaculture design, and silage production using anaerobic fermentation, is changing the image of agave and their companion trees. This agave-powered agroforestry and livestock management system is demonstrating that native plants, long overlooked, have the potential to regenerate the drylands, provide large amounts of inexpensive but essential forage for grazing animals, and alleviate rural poverty.\n\n[Read on](https://regenerationinternational.org/2020/12/23/agave-power-greening-the-desert/)",

It helps rebuild coastal ecosystems by creating a sanctuary for other types of marine life, and acts as a natural buffer to protect the coastline against storm surges (a more likely occurrence in the age of climate change). For all its benefits, it requires very little from its cultivators—no fertilizer, fresh water, or land—and grows quickly and cheaply. \n\n[Read on](https://www.saveur.com/bren-smith-kelp-farmer/)",

He and his late wife Dolores started the School of Self-Reliance to continue their educational and publishing efforts. Christopher has always been driven by the desire to live a more self-reliant life-style, even in the city, and to share those lessons with those who wish to live likewise. Today, the school has evolved into teaching several dozen different classes and class-series, working with many highly-qualified teachers, reaching people of all ages and all walks of life.\n\nMany of the skills that the School of Self Reliance teach are very basic, and would have been common knowledge a century ago.  Besides learning the skills and lifestyles of self-reliance, they encourage people to become an active and positive part of their societies.  They are not isolationists, but believe in working within the guidelines of existing society.\n\n## How to enroll\n\nRegister for an in person or online class at the school. Options include classes on cooking with foraged ingredients as well as medicinal properties of native plants. \n\n[Schedule here](http://www.schoolofself-reliance.com/events/)",

This not only conserves water, but it cuts down on your monthly water bill providing significant end-of-year savings. Showers take energy to heat the water, thus cutting down on water usage also cuts down on energy usage. You can expect to save up to $50 annually on heating costs. It also cuts down on carbon dioxide emissions. Since the demand for hot water is lessened, the amount of energy used is lower and results in lower CO2 dispersed into the air.

And should the customer decide to further their energy savings efforts, the Program  reduces the amount of money a  customer needs to invest in order to participate in the single-family or multifamily home upgrade programs. \n \nThe program is available to renters and homeowners living in single-family and multifamily dwellings. Program services are provided by authorized vendors who are not employees of SoCalGas® or Sempra Utilities, but are under contract to SoCalGas to deliver program services.

    "description": "## How\nWeather-based “Smart” Controllers for irrigation work on a simple principle: provide the appropriate watering schedule, adjust for weather changes and irrigate based on the needs of the landscape and soil conditions. A smart controller will automatically reduce the watering times as the weather gets cooler and less water is needed. Then as the weather begins to warm up, the controller will add more watering time. The way this typically works is that you set the controller for a default maximum watering time, based on the hottest time of year. Then the controller reduces that time amount by a percentage value when less water is needed.\n\nThere are a variety of weather-based “smart” controllers available for commercial applications. Whether it is real-time on-site weather data, off-site data with internet access, historical weather data or on-site monitoring, the new “smart” controllers leave little room for error.\n\n## What\nRebates Start At:\n$80/Controller & $35/Station – Eligible WBIC can have a maximum of 11 inactive stations per controller\n$80/Controller for Less than 1 Acre of Landscape & $35/Station for More than 1 Acre of Landscape.\n\nWBICs can save you from overwatering your landscape by 13,500 gallons a year and ensure optimal plant health.\n\nCustomizing your water schedule with WBICs can save over $700 on your water bill over its lifetime. Combine this with SoCal Water$mart rebates and the savings can add up!\n\nWBICs can save you from overwatering your landscape by 13,500 gallons a year and ensure optimal plant health.\n\n**Cutting-Edge, Superior Performance\n\nSoCal Water$mart-recommended WBICs are tested by independent evaluators to ensure superior performance.\nThey can thoroughly evaluate site conditions and prepare irrigation watering schedules to meet the needs of your home’s landscape.\n\n[Qualifying irrigation controllers pdf](https://socalwatersmart.com/files/pdfs/qualifying_list_wbics.pdf)\n\n## Rebate link\n[Sign up for rebates here](https://mwddevice.conservationrebates.com)\n",

Plants and microbes prefer rainwater because it is naturally “soft” and free of chlorine, fluoride and other chemicals.\n\nApplicants may not submit a rebate claim for both rain barrels and cisterns. Customers who purchase one or more rain barrels must submit for all eligible rain barrels on a single application. Submitting one application for the rain barrel(s) or cistern will prevent customers from receiving a rebate for any subsequent rain barrel or cistern purchase(s).\n\nBecause Rain Barrels are excluded from the CDRO (Contractor Direct Rebate Option), applications submitted must make the rebate payable to the water bill account holder, and the address listed on the application must match the installation address, or the mailing address on the water bill.\n\n## Product\n• Rain Barrel (50-199 gallons) (max. quantity: 2) Rebate $35.00\n\n• Cistern (200-500 gallons) (max. quantity: 1) Rebate $250.00\n\n• Cistern (501-999 gallons) (max. quantity: 1) Rebate $300.00\n\n• Cistern (1000+ gallons) (max. quantity: 1) Rebate $350.00\n\n[Rain barrel guidelines](https://socalwatersmart.com/en/residential/rebates/available-rebates/rain-barrels-cisterns/)\n\n[Cistern guidelines](https://socalwatersmart.com/en/residential/rebates/available-rebates/rain-barrels-cisterns/)\n\n## Rebate link\n\n[Sign up for rebates here](https://mwddevice.conservationrebates.com)\n",

    "description": "## What\n\nIf you have ever unscrewed the end of a kitchen or bathroom faucet or felt inside with your finger, you may have discovered a device with a small metal screen disk—a faucet aerator. The aerator is an important feature that both improves the physical operation of the faucet and enhances the experience of using the faucet. \n\nRemoving the aerator and tapping it out upside-down may release a small piece of grit or scale produced by the inside of the pipes. While an aerator does filter debris, this is not its main purpose. Rather, a faucet aerator improves the flow of water and helps it feel softer to the touch. By introducing small bubbles to the water, the faucet aerator allows the faucet to run longer while using less water.

    "description": "## What\n\nA duct system that is well-designed and properly sealed can make your home more comfortable, energy efficient, and safer. Energy used in our homes often comes from the burning of fossil fuels at power plants, which contributes to smog, acid rain, and climate change. Simply put, the less energy we use in our homes, the less air pollution we generate. By sealing your ducts and reducing the amount of energy necessary to comfortably heat or cool your home, you can reduce the amount of air pollution generated.\n\n\n## How To Get Your Own\n\nResidential Direct Install (RES DI) Program is a no-cost energy assistance program for SoCalGas customers, this program replaces the Middle Income Direct Install (MIDI) program and has no income requirements.\n \nThe Program provides no-cost energy improvements to eligible customers to help make  their homes more comfortable and help conserve energy, which could lead to lower utility bills. And should the customer decide to further their energy savings efforts, the Program  reduces the amount of money a  customer needs to invest in order to participate in the single-family or multifamily home upgrade programs. \n \nThe program is available to renters and homeowners living in single-family and multifamily dwellings. Program services are provided by authorized vendors who are not employees of SoCalGas® or Sempra Utilities, but are under contract to SoCalGas to deliver program services. A qualified contractor will assess your home for energy-saving services and program eligibility, a minimum of 3 must be installed.\n\n[Apply Here](https://www.socalgas.com/save-money-and-energy/assistance-programs/energy-savings-assistance-program).",

This makes them two to three times more efficient, according to the Department of Energy (DOE). If every household in the United States used a heat pump water heater (under 55 gallons), the energy cost savings would top $8.2 billion dollars a year, according to Energy Star. A heat pump water heater can save your household of four people around $330 a year on your electric bill, according to the government website Energy Star. That adds up to a savings of around $3,400 over the life of a typical heat pump water heater.

One inch of rain falling on the roof of an average sized single family home can generate over 1,200 gallons of runoff. Most buildings in California are designed to direct rainwater straight into the street. As this runoff travels through our urban landscape it picks up pollutants and bacteria that cause 20,000+ beach closures and advisories nationwide every year. \n\n[Read on](https://la.surfrider.org/programs/ocean-friendly-gardens/)",

North Dakota rancher Gabe Brown walks us through a common sense solution to this crisis.\n\nGabe Brown is one of the pioneers of the current soil health movement that focuses on regenerating our resources. Gabe, along with his wife, Shelly, and son, Paul, own and operate a diversified 5,000-acre farm and ranch near Bismarck, ND. Their operation focuses on farming and ranching in nature’s image.\n\nThe Browns holistically integrate their grazing and no-till cropping systems, which include a wide variety of cash crops, multi-species cover crops along with all natural grass finished beef and lamb. They also raise pastured laying hens, broilers and swine. This diversity and integration has regenerated the natural resources on the ranch without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides. \n\n[Watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfTZ0rnowcc)",

A more natural approach to laundry is crucial for the health of humans and the planet, so consider our practical steps on how to make the switch. \n\n[Read on](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/less-laundry-less-often-how-to-lighten-the-washday-load-on-the-environment)",

The other 5% of the water would be used to carry biosolids down to Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant where they would be processed to generate electricity. \n\nThe Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant interfaces with the public through a Japanese Garden with a theme of the peaceful, beautiful uses of water. \n\nAdults – $5, Seniors (62+) – $3, Children (under 12) – $3. \n\n[Visit this stunning landscape during the garden's operating hours](https://thejapanesegarden.com/visit/hours-and-admission/)",

The weapon of choice is an array of chemical pesticides. There’s another way to engage this persistent enemy. Instead of turning garden storage areas into an armory stockpiled and resupplied with chemical pesticides, the battle can be fought in a more environmentally friendly way. A bonus is that the cost of the battle can be paid for with a song.

Their incredible project will include 300 trees and will take up to 10 years to complete.\n\nThe effects of trees are multifold – they increase home values (A tree placed in front of a home will boost property values by an average of $7,000), mitigate the urban heat island effect, protect vulnerable populations from the sun, reduce utility bills, and much more.\n\nIt may come as a surprise that TreePeople doesn’t plant trees in neighborhoods. Instead, we engage communities and support the process of planting trees in neighborhoods. We provide tools, advice, and guidance, but at the end of the day, it’s up to the Angelenos who take on these projects to get them done.\n\nWe believe that community organizing is key to creating lasting change because there are too many trees in LA for one organization to care for; it’s up to locals of every neighborhood to maintain their homes and support the greater tree canopy.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.treepeople.org/2019/04/10/celebrating-our-urban-foresters/)",

Love ‘em or hate ‘em they are hard to ignore – whether they are producing lovely flowers or taking over the garden!\n\n**What really is a weed?**\nBasically, it is a plant growing where you don’t want it to grow.  When caring for your low-water use, climate-appropriate garden, weeds can overtake a garden (especially after a good season of rain) competing with your plants for water, nutrients, light and dominating the space.  \n\nAt first, they seem harmless. However, left to grow, they continue to spread their seeds each year and can take over your sustainable landscape.\n\n[Learn more](https://blog.treepeople.org/treepeople-news/2019/05/weeds-of-the-garden%EF%BB%BF) ",

    "description": "## What\nLand use directly affects how water moves through communities\nLand use in urban communities ranges from open space and agriculture to varying levels of development. Developed land often consists of impervious surfaces, such as asphalt and concrete.\n\nWhen land is paved, water is not able to soak into the ground. Too much water flowing across the hardened landscape can result in flooding and/or erosion. Water that flows over the hardened landscape is lost to the oceans and streams when it is directed into the storm drain systems that lead directly into rivers and oceans.\n\nThis untreated water is called urban runoff. Urban runoff, carrying pollutants such as automotive fluids, trash and pesticides, is the biggest source of pollution in our rivers and ocean.\nHarvesting rainwater offers many benefits for communities. Capturing rainwater not only helps keep our waterways and ocean clean, but helps to replenish our groundwater supply and reduce our dependence on imported water.\n\nPotential strategies for catching and storing water include creating rain gardens, bioswales, bioretention ponds; protecting open space; removing hardscape; and redirecting rainwater that falls on rooftops and parking lots into large tanks (cisterns) where it can be stored for later use.\n\nThese various methods function to keep our waterways and ocean clean, and help replenish our groundwater supply and reduce our dependence on imported water. Additionally, sustainable landscaping and irrigation practices can reduce and treat urban runoff while also conserving water.\n\n[Read on](https://watertalks.csusb.edu/how-does-land-use-affect-our-water)",

Another advantage of larger trees could be to provide a sound barrier if you live in an area that's near traffic or other disturbing noises. No matter what your needs, you will need to know how to choose where to plant trees in order to reap the most benefits. \n\n[Read on](https://www.wikihow.com/Choose-Where-to-Plant-Trees#:~:text=Plant%20your%20tree%20where%20it%20can%20provide%20shade,adding%20them%20to%20your%20yard%20for%20decorative%20purposes.)",
