With Los Angeles expected to grow in size and population in the coming years, the threat of the cycle between extreme weather like El Niño and the drought becoming the norm seems reason enough for the city to review and replace its outdated and single-use grey water infrastructure system with something greener and more water re-use efficient.

“A sponge city is one that can hold, clean, and drain water in a natural way using an ecological approach,” said Yu, who is helping to coordinate the national project. According to The Guardian, these projects will include developing rooftop gardens, ponds, filtration pools, and wetlands, with permeable roads and public spaces designed to soak rainwater back into the ground.”

There are many factors that go into planting a yard tree, so we encourage you to consider all the right conditions for your particular species.

“Right tree” means the species and full-grown size of the tree is best suited for your home and the area you have available to plant the tree. You can reference our Yard Tree List [here](https://www.cityplants.org/yard-tree-species-list/) to determine how tall your new tree will grow and how the species will mature over time. Keep the full-grown size of your tree in mind when finding its spot.

“Right place” means the tree has enough space to grow to its full, mature height, and its root system has the space it needs to grow fully without interfering with surrounding infrastructure or underground pipes or utility lines. Don’t forget to plant to the west or east of your building to help reduce your energy bills and save energy!

## Where Should I Plant My Yard Tree?
It’s best to plant trees a minimum of 15 – 20 feet away from your foundation, to the west, southwest, or east side of your building. 

You can call 811 at least two days before you plant to make sure you won’t run into any gas or utility lines while planting — they’ll come out for free to inspect for you!

If you plant multiple trees, make sure to space them far enough apart. Large trees should be planted at least 30 feet apart. 

Trees throw major shade! As days get hotter and hotter, trees act as natural air conditioners. 

West is best for energy savings, as the trees will shade your home in the hot afternoon sun and save you $$ on your energy bills!

Planting trees on the east side of your home helps shade it from the morning sun (and some energy savings), but planting to the north will not provide much shade at all.

## How
1. DIG: Dig a hole at least twice the width of the tree’s container and just as deep as the soil in the pot. You can use your shovel as a measuring stick!

2. PLACE TREE: 
* Remove the tree from the pot. Avoid damaging the root ball. 
* "Massage” or loosen the roots gently to open them up,  so that they can grow outward and get off to a good start. If there are any large “circling” roots, cut them, as they can actually strangle your new tree. 
* Drop the mycorrhizal tablets in the hole (that came with your tree)
* Place the tree in the hole. 

3. BACKFILL: 
* Refill the hole with soil. Make sure the top of the root ball (where the trunk meets the roots and flares out) is 1 to 2 inches ABOVE the surrounding soil level (if a root ball is below soil level, your tree may die). 
* Lightly poke the soil around the root ball to eliminate all air pockets. 
* Be careful not to pile soil on top of the root ball or against the root flare. You want to keep your root flare exposed so it can breathe!  
* Using native soil is great, as it helps the tree adapt to its new environment. Skip the fertilizer, soil amendment, or potting soil!

4. BUILD A BERM: 
* Form the remaining soil into a berm or a “moat” around the tree. 
* It should look like a donut of soil around the tree, which will ensure that water sinks directly into the tree’s roots.', 'Do it', 'Why', 'In case it''s your first time, here''s our guide to tree planting.', 'I''ve planted a tree', 'planted a tree', NULL, '1800 seconds'::interval, '0 seconds'::interval);

For your tree(s) to survive their first few years of life, they need what we call deep watering, to establish their root systems. Deep watering is the practice of slowly trickling 10-15 gallons of water into the watering basin around the base of a tree. Sprinklers will not sufficiently water young trees. While they are good for grass, we want water to filter deep into the soil around the tree to encourage the roots to grow deeply. 

As a rule of thumb, your tree(s) need 10-15 gallons a week, but during the warmer months, when temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit, you will need to water your trees more frequently. Read on for important tips and tricks!

## How
Fill a 5-gallon bucket of water and gently pour into the tree berm 2-3 times. You can also put a hose on a slow trickle for 1-2 hours. Make sure to water the soil around the tree — not the trunk or the leaves, which can kill your young tree!

How to care for young trees [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWVOLK7G2m4)

## When should you water your tree?
Water early in the morning or after sunset, when the sun won’t evaporate water as readily.

1ST & 2ND YEAR: Deep water your shade tree once a week with 10-15 gallons. Water your fruit tree 17-20 gallons once a week. During warmer months, you may need to water your tree(s) more frequently. 

3RD YEAR: Deep water every 4-6 weeks during the year, water a little more during the summer. Continue to check the soil for its moisture level if you’re not certain whether or not the tree needs water.

Save Your Trees From Drought [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiHmGdUP8hQ)

## TIPS:
Tip 1: If you are ever unsure if you need to water, check the soil! Try this out:
* Dig 2 - 3 inches into the soil around the root ball of your tree and grab a handful of soil.
* Squeeze the soil into a ball. 
* If the soil crumbles, your tree needs more water! 
* If the soil sticks together, your tree has enough moisture. It’s important not to overwater a tree too, because roots need oxygen, just like we do, and when they are too submerged in water, they are not able to breathe. 

Tip 2: A newly planted tree uses the same amount of water as a 5-minute shower each week — Not too much at all! Collect excess water from your shower in a bucket and use it to water your new tree.

Tip 4: Rainwater is precious here. Consider collecting rainwater to water your new tree when seasons permit.

Tip 5: If you water your tree with a hose, time how long it takes to fill a 5-gallon bucket with the hose set on a slow trickle, multiply that by 2-3 times. That is the time you will let your hose run when watering your tree. Make sure that the water does not escape the berm, but stays inside the tree well and soaks deep down into the roots.

Reminder: Trees are like natural air conditioners. The 5-gallon trees you planted will not yield immediate shade. However, planting trees when they are young allows them to establish themselves early, and if planted correctly, they will grow vigorously and eventually help cool both you and your home.

Conventionally grown cotton is not only one of the most traded crops on the planet—supplying billons of clothing and other various textile products each year—but it is also one of the most chemically intensive crops to produce. In the United States, cotton ranks third after corn and soybeans as the crop that requires the most pesticides in its production. In 2019, more than 68 million pounds of pesticide were applied to cotton fields across the U.S. alone. Additionally, most conventional cotton farmers plant genetically engineered seed, resulting in higher chemical application and the engineering of more robust products that have known environmental and human health impacts. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in the widely used herbicide Roundup, made up more than one third of all pesticide use on cotton in 2019 according to the USDA.

“We wanted to do something that would look a little bit deeper and incorporate farmer and processor experiences in addition to the more academic knowledge that we have about the environmental impacts of organic cotton,” Shade notes. She says a lot of growers commented on perceivable improvements in things like soil quality and increased biodiversity on their farms since transitioning to organic.

The Barn Owl Nesting Box Program is part of CLAW''s commitment to ending the use of rodent poison (rodenticide) in Los Angeles and beyond. Rodenticide is extremely dangerous to the wildlife populations that live where urban and natural worlds interact. 

Just one Barn Owl can consume over 3,000 rodents a year and are already being used to control rodent populations in vineyards, farms and ranches around the world. Luckily, barn owls have a high tolerance for humans and often choose to nest in proximity to us, making perfect neighbors even in an urban setting. 

Barn owls are one of three species of owls native to Los Angeles.

Barn owls are a permanent source of rodent control without pesticides or chemicals.

Since the largest prey a barn owl can capture is a rodent, they are not a threat to pets.

The more barn owl boxes we place in a community, the greater the odds are that the owls will find and nest in them. Second and third generation owls will then return to the nests.

The Barn Owl Nesting Box Program is part of CLAW''s commitment to ending the use of rodent poison (rodenticide) in Los Angeles and beyond. Rodenticide is extremely dangerous to the wildlife populations that live where urban and natural worlds interact. 

Just one barn owl can consume over 3,000 rodents a year and are already being used to control rodent populations in vineyards, farms and ranches around the world. Luckily, barn owls have a high tolerance for humans and often choose to nest in proximity to us, making perfect neighbors even in an urban setting. 
About Barn Owls
Barn owls are one of three species of owls native to Los Angeles.

Barn owls are a permanent source of rodent control without pesticides or chemicals.

Since the largest prey a barn owl can capture is a rodent, they are not a threat to pets.

The more barn owl boxes we place in a community, the greater the odds are that the owls will find and nest in them. Second and third generation owls will then return to the nests.

Barn owls can lay two clutches of owlets a year.
Getting Ready for Your Box
First, we ask you to visit your closest neighbors and tell them you will be hosting a Barn Owl Nesting Box. We suggest that you download our Barn Owl Box Program flyers to educate them about the effects of rodenticide and the role that a Barn Owl will play in controlling the rodent population if it nests in your neighborhood. We recommend that a neighborhood become poison-free for at least three months before installing a nesting box. This will prevent your owl from succumbing to secondary rodenticide poisoning.

Nesting box orders are placed in the CLAW Shop section of the website, and 50% of your order is considered a tax deductible donation. Once ordered, our volunteers will promptly begin the process of crafting your box. 

We provide instructions that show how you or a handyman can mount the box, how to care for the box, and 10 program flyers to distribute to neighbors.

A Barn Owl''s nesting season is at least once a year, sometimes twice. The rest of the year, the owls will stay in the area but won''t need a box.

Rodents, Poison and You

Owls alone might not solve your rodent problem, but please don''t use poison.  Traditional rat traps, electric zappers or an abatement specialist can be very effective without poisoning other wildlife.

Climate Resolve has worked with the community of Canoga Park on implementing new street designs they would like to see around the Metro Orange Line Station at Sherman Way. The project aims to address a number of concerns: improving biking and walking safety, capturing and managing water, reducing heat and its impacts, and providing community amenities. As extreme heat days become more frequent in the San Fernando Valley, it is especially important to incorporate designs that will decrease the urban heat island effect and improve the lives of Angelenos.

In 2015, we gathered a small group of our Venice Beach neighbors to reconnect our broken and disconnected community.  We built 80 street-side raised gardens to connect to the power of nature by growing food for our neighbors in need. Through the simple act of gardening, we are living proof that all things grow with love.

Today, Community Healing Gardens’ provides hands-on garden and climate education, healthy locally-grown food for those in need, job training, and economic opportunity by cultivating deep collaborations with the Los Angeles schools and communities we serve.

Our goal is to design and build gardens with many Los Angeles partners - connecting schools, communities, and home gardens throughout our Los Angeles giving us green places to connect, heal, and thrive.

When water falls from the sky in Los Angeles, the city captures a little; in a year, they manage to get ahold of 27,000 acre-feet of water on average. (One acre-foot is equal to about 326,000 gallons—enough for two households for a year.) But after four years of severe statewide drought, the LA Department of Water and Power is considering an enormous rainwater capture plan that could possibly yield between 100,000 and 200,000 more acre-feet of water a year by 2035, says the LA Times.

Electric bikes belong in a category of their own because they’re more than just a fun tech fad. They could actually be the future of transportation.

## PEDAL POWER BOOST
Of course, e-bikes aren’t new or without controversy. Some feel threatened by the rising popularity of e-bikes, as though standard bikes will suddenly vanish like the penny-farthing once everyone goes electric. Rest assured: e-bikes won’t make human-powered mobility obsolete. They may actually enhance it.


## THE TIME IS NOW
That said, there’s really no better time than right now to start shopping for an electric bike. The market is flooded with battery-powered bikes of all shapes and sizes. Boutique upstarts are jockeying for funding on Indiegogo and Kickstarter, while a handful of European companies are pushing the envelope with a variety of high-tech designs. Meanwhile, major bike manufacturers are finally waking up to the profit potential of e-bikes and are introducing their own lineups. Prices are fluctuating, but you can get a solidly built, reliable e-bike for less than $1,000.


## HOW E BIKES WILL TRANSFORM TRANSPORTATION
E-bikes lower the barriers to biking, making it easier for people who are older or more anxious about the stresses and strains of biking to justify riding. You’re more likely to ditch your car or delete your Uber app if you know you can get to where you’re going faster and more efficiently without getting overly tired or sweaty.

More importantly, e-bikes can rescue cities from the clutches of car culture. As noted by Curbed’s Alissa Walker:

A 2018 study by the National Institute for Transportation and Communities that surveyed 1,800 e-bike riders found that they bike more often, take longer trips, and make different types of trips than they do on pedal bikes.

Not only did more respondents feel safer riding an e-bike than they did riding a pedal bike, the percentage of people who felt safer on an e-bike was even greater when the respondents were women, over 55, or had physical limitations.

“E-bikes are making it possible for more people to ride a bicycle” reads the study, “many of whom are incapable of riding a standard bicycle or don’t feel safe doing so.”

If you’re worried that electric power will take all the fun and recreation out of biking, well, you’re wrong. Another study looked at the cognitive and psychological effects of outdoor cycling and found equal results for traditional bikes and e-bikes. Climate change got you down? E-bikes are more sustainable than electric cars, and they will help clear up traffic congestion and make cities more livable. Besides, you can always shut off the motor if you’re looking for a little exercise.

As cities become more congested, some businesses are turning to e-bikes to make their deliveries. Domino’s is using Rad Power Bikes to deliver pizza in a couple of cities. UPS is using cargo bikes in Seattle. German delivery company DPD wants to use these cute mini-trucks that are actually e-bikes in disguise. In New York City, e-bikes are almost exclusively used by food delivery workers.

Don’t be fooled: the US is still far behind the rest of the world when it comes to bikes. We see them more as recreational vehicle than as a transportation alternative, something you use in fair weather, not in the rain and snow like the Dutch. But come on, the US women’s national soccer team beat the Netherlands in the World Cup, so surely we can compete in the saddle as well?

Streets in the US are designed for cars, and bikes and pedestrians are often just an afterthought. This marginalization has caused a shameful spike in cyclist and pedestrian deaths nationwide. E-bikes won’t reverse that trend unless enough people stop driving and start pedaling. Only then will cities find themselves confronted with the choice between maintaining the status quo or redesigning their streets to be more livable, walkable, and bikeable.

Electric bikes can make getting around so much easier for everyone, including older people and people with different abilities.

The trees you see on your walk through the woods are not only a beautiful sight—they’re giving you a lesson to take back to your landscape!

Take a tip from trees in the natural setting when you tackle mulching. Proper tree mulching helps trees retain water, combat weeds and regulate soil temperature. Below, we answer the most common questions about how to apply mulch to trees.  

## How
The key is to let nature be your guide. Trees in a natural setting aren’t covered up to their trunks. A rule of thumb is to keep the trees’ root flare—the spot where the tree trunk ends and the roots begin—free of mulch.

Volcano mulching, or piling mulch up against the trunk or stem of a tree, creates a cool, damp hideaway that attracts fungus, disease and pests.

## How much mulch should I apply to my trees?
2 to 4 inches of mulch layered around the base of your tree is all you need.

First, spread the mulch around your tree, then use a rake or shovel to evenly pull the mulch out to the furthest edges of the tree’s canopy.

The Eat Real process begins with pairing both an Eat REAL team member and a Registered Dietician (RD) with each school district. The independent third-party RD performs  a baseline assessment. With this information, Eat REAL supports the school district to create an action plan.

We recognize that districts require time to make adjustments to menus, sourcing, and, in some cases, facilities and equipment, needed for increased scratch cooking and adapted procurement. This initial undertaking can span a year or more. The partnership continues as school districts  continue to make improvements and seek higher levels of certification.

Soil restoration is the process of improving the structure, microbial life, nutrient density, and overall carbon levels of soil. Many human endeavors – conventional farming chief among them – have depleted the Earth to the extent that nutrient levels in almost every kind of food have fallen by between 10 and 100 percent in the past 70 years. Soil quality can improve dramatically, though, when farmers and gardeners maintain constant ground cover, increase microbe populations, encourage biological diversity, reduce the use of agricultural chemicals, and avoid tillage.

Trees and other plants help cool the environment, making vegetation a simple and effective way to reduce urban heat islands.
Trees and vegetation lower surface and air temperatures by providing shade and through evapotranspiration. Shaded surfaces, for example, may be 20–45°F (11–25°C) cooler than the peak temperatures of unshaded materials.1 Evapotranspiration, alone or in combination with shading, can help reduce peak summer temperatures by 2–9°F (1–5°C).

Trees and vegetation are most useful as a mitigation strategy when planted in strategic locations around buildings or to shade pavement in parking lots and on streets. Researchers have found that planting deciduous trees or vines to the west is typically most effective for cooling a building, especially if they shade windows and part of the building’s roof.

## Benefits and Costs
The use of trees and vegetation in the urban environment brings benefits beyond mitigating urban heat islands including:

Reduced energy use: Trees and vegetation that directly shade buildings decrease demand for air conditioning.
Improved air quality and lower greenhouse gas emissions: By reducing energy demand, trees and vegetation decrease the production of associated air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. They also remove air pollutants and store and sequester carbon dioxide.

Enhanced stormwater management and water quality: Vegetation reduces runoff and improves water quality by absorbing and filtering rainwater.

Reduced pavement maintenance: Tree shade can slow deterioration of street pavement, decreasing the amount of maintenance needed.

Improved quality of life: Trees and vegetation provide aesthetic value, habitat for many species, and can reduce noise.

The primary costs associated with planting and maintaining trees or other vegetation include purchasing materials, initial planting, and ongoing maintenance activities such as pruning, pest and disease control, and irrigation.

A study of urban forestry programs in five U.S. cities showed a range of expenditures: annual costs ranged from almost $15 per tree in the Desert Southwest region to $65 per tree in Berkeley, California. Pruning was often the greatest expenditure, accounting for roughly 25–40% of total annual costs (approximately $4–$20/tree). Administration and inspection costs were the next largest expenditure, ranging from approximately 8–35% of annual expenditures (about $4–$6/tree). Tree planting, surprisingly, accounted for just 2–15% of total annual urban forestry expenditures (roughly $0.50–$4/tree) in these cities.

Although the benefits of urban forestry can vary considerably by community and tree species, they are almost always higher than the costs. The five-city study discussed above found that, on a per-tree basis, the cities accrued benefits ranging from about $1.50–$3.00 for every dollar invested. These cities spent roughly $15–$65 annually per tree, with net annual benefits ranging from approximately $30–$90 per tree.

Falling Fruit is a celebration of the overlooked culinary bounty of our city streets. By quantifying this resource on an interactive map, we hope to facilitate intimate connections between people, food, and the natural organisms growing in our neighborhoods. Not just a free lunch! Foraging in the 21st century is an opportunity for urban exploration, to fight the scourge of stained sidewalks, and to reconnect with the botanical origins of food.

## How
[Check out our edible](https://fallingfruit.org/?c=forager%2Cfreegan&locale=en) map.  Not the first of its kind, but it aspires to be the world''s most comprehensive. While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. The imported datasets range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. This so far amounts to 2,341 different types of edibles (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over 1,395,231 locations. Beyond the cultivated and commonplace to the exotic flavors of foreign plants and long-forgotten native plants, foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time and across cultures.

Join us in celebrating hyper-local food! The map is open for anyone to edit, the database can be downloaded with just one click, and the code is open-source. You are likewise encouraged to share the bounty with your fellow humans. Our sharing page lists hundreds of local organizations - planting public orchards and food forests, picking otherwise-wasted fruits and vegetables from city trees and farmers'' fields, and sharing with neighbors and the needy. Don''t forget to book mark the page!

If you bike down a street on the edge of Los Angeles’s Echo Park neighborhood, you’ll see a sudden change in the pavement on one block, where the black asphalt shifts to white. A little over a year ago, the city covered the street with a special coating—light in color, so it reflects the sun—as part of a plan to help cool L.A. as the world keeps getting hotter.

Like most cities, L.A. is facing more frequent and extreme heat waves. One new study that mapped out rising heat across the country found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current path, the average number of days in a year across the U.S. that feel hotter than 100 degrees will more than double by the middle of the century. Some cities will have it worst: In Miami, by the end of the century, 153 days each year could feel that hot. Globally, cities that were relatively cool in the past are beginning to grapple with buildings that weren’t built for heat (like Berlin, where the average high in June is 72 degrees, but climbed to 101 degrees one day last month, the hottest June on record for the planet). Cities also suffer from the urban heat island effect: Hot temperatures get even hotter as pavement and buildings soak up and release radiation from the sun.

There are several ways cities can prepare for extreme heat, from changes in infrastructure—like solar and battery “microgrids” that can keep air conditioning on at cooling centers if the heat takes the grid down—to shifts to different cooling technology, like geothermal power. But three solutions are both particularly simple and particularly helpful. “We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” says Matt Petersen, president and CEO of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator and the former chief sustainability officer for the City of L.A. “That’s job number one, for long-term benefit to reduce the most extreme heat from happening. But now that extreme heat is here, we need to make sure we put in place strategies to reduce the new normal of extreme urban heat through cool streets, cool roofs, and robust urban tree canopy.”

The biggest problem with most urban water systems is that half or more of many cities’ water comes from snowmelt–which often has to travel a great distance at great economic and environmental cost.

LA’s water system, for example, relies on its supply from snowpack in the distant Sierras; a supply that seemed predictable and infinite 100 years ago. We now know that’s not true—this year’s snowpack is at 5 percent of normal. The shift that needs to occur is moving LA’s primary source of water from imported snowmelt to captured stormwater, says Hadley.

## How?

Planting a garden has the power to change the world. Climate Victory Gardens are part of the climate solution by restoring soil health to draw down carbon. Everyone can grow a garden, and everyone can take meaningful action on the climate crisis.

## Why

Climate Victory Gardens are inspired by the collective action of Americans taken during the WWI and WWII victory gardening movement, when 20 million gardeners produced 40% of the fresh fruits and vegetables consumed in the country at the time. We''re bringing victory gardens back. This time, it''s for the climate.

Nearly a third of all food produced around the globe is wasted. It may be discarded in the growing, harvesting or preservation phases, as happens in poorer countries, or it may be thrown out, as especially happens in richer countries, by inattentive consumers and shop owners who don’t keep the still-edible surplus. This enormous quantity of food (nearly 1.3 billion tonnes per year according to WWF estimates) is four times that needed to feed the 800 million people currently living in a state of malnutrition. 

Wasted food has an impact on the environment in all phases of its lifecycle, each of which leaves a deep environmental “footprint” in terms of water, soil and greenhouse gas emissions. ReFED, an American coalition working to stop food waste, estimates that cutting discarded food in the United States by 20% could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18 million tonnes in ten years.

Seaweed is loaded with protein, brimming with carbohydrates and, yes, grows like a weed, which explains why it has been a staple of many Asian diets since prehistoric times.

Still, seaweed is hardly ubiquitous on Western dinner plates, and the thought of it monopolizing a meal might give some people pause. But Amanda Stiles and Beth Zotter want to see seaweed dominate the alt-protein supply chain and change how we eat for good. “Our goal is to develop the most sustainable supply chain for protein on Earth,” says Zotter, who cofounded the seaweed start-up Trophic with Stiles, a biochemist and former head of research at Ripple Foods, in 2018 after a stint in biofuels.

Volunteer while staying safe and practicing physical distancing through Heal the Bay’s *Adopt a Beach* program. Commit to three cleanups in one year at your chosen outdoor place (a neighborhood, beach, park, creek, or trail) anywhere in Greater Los Angeles. Use our new app to track the trash you remove and help change environmental policies locally and globally.

Heal the Bay’s *Adopt-a-Beach* Program gives individuals and households the opportunity to learn about and participate in the conservation of our outdoor places. All participants will receive a virtual safety talk from Heal the Bay’s Speakers Bureau, educational resources, and fun games, as well as an official Certificate of Completion from Heal the Bay and California Coastal Commission.

Famed architect Frank Gehry is working with Los Angeles County officials and numerous nonprofits and stakeholder groups to create a comprehensive plan for the whole river. The river was one of the selling points in the city’s winning bid for the 2028 Olympics. Developers are still clamoring to build along the river’s banks.

The last time the LA River was reborn it was the late 1930s, and it had been drowning the young city periodically since its birth. At some points, the river was just a trickle; in other parts, it was uncontrollably wild, and flooded frequently and devastatingly.

One photographer painstakingly reshot old photos of the once-volatile waterway. 

When the L.A. River Master Plan is released to the public, you can provide comments about the changes you would like to see in the watershed. The Flows Plan has not been released yet, but the public will have the opportunity to comment when it is released. As plans are implemented, you will have the opportunity to weigh in on each individual project that gets implemented. We recommend tracking these projects on the L.A. River Master Plan, Lower L.A. River Master Plan, ULART Plan, LARRMP, and L.A. River Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Study websites.

"I’ve never had the luxury of owning my own home, but the rental place where I live is a good example of why most 20th-century homebuilding isn’t fit to achieve net-zero emissions in the 21st century. As is common in California, our house is wood-framed and has a flat, wood-and-tar roof. There’s no insulation in the walls or the roof (there is no attic space), and the long front of the house is floor-to-ceiling glass. Which sounds nice, but it sucks heat out of the house in winter and traps heat in the summer. In short, it couldn’t be less energy efficient.

Many tenants are in the same position. But in Europe, where a high percentage of citizens rent rather than own, there’s far more incentive for the private and public sector to create zero-carbon housing stock.

Symbiotic Earth explores the life and ideas of scientific rebel Lynn Margulis who challenged entrenched theories of male-dominated science. As a young scientist in the 1960s, Margulis was ridiculed when she first proposed that symbiosis – when organisms live and work together — was a key driver of evolution, but she persisted. Through numerous collaborations she caused a seismic shift in our understanding of life.

Narrated and featuring Woody Harrelson, ''Kiss the Ground'' is an inspiring and groundbreaking film that reveals the first viable solution to our climate crisis.

Kiss the Ground reveals that, by regenerating the world’s soils, we can completely and rapidly stabilize Earth’s climate, restore lost ecosystems and create abundant food supplies. Using compelling graphics and visuals, along with striking NASA and NOAA footage, the film artfully illustrates how, by drawing down atmospheric carbon, soil is the missing piece of the climate puzzle.

Like most big cities, Los Angeles literally creates its own climate. Buildings and asphalt absorb and radiate heat, raising summer temperatures by as much as 19 degrees in some parts of the region. According to CalEPA, LA has the worst urban heat island effect of any region in California.

Excessive heat is deadly. Heat stroke, heat exhaustion, difficulty breathing, cramping and general discomfort killed more people between 1979 and 2003 than hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods and earthquakes combined, according to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. 

The number of extremely hot days is expected to triple by mid-century. That’s why LA Mayor Eric Garcetti has the goal of lowering this urban heat island effect three degrees by 2035. 

Can the city do it?

Mulch is any type of material that is spread or laid over the surface of the soil as a covering. It is used to retain moisture in the soil, suppress weeds, keep the soil cool, and make the garden bed look more attractive. LA Sanitation creates high-quality mulch from the green waste collected from homes across the City. This mulch is available free to residents!

Instructions: Bring your own shovel, bag or pick-up; load up your own containers and take as much as you need.

Similar to Community Compost Hubs, Compost Co-ops are located in gardens, schools, and parks. Compost Co-ops also require members to sign an agreement before joining and volunteer at the site to continue their membership. At this time there is no monetary cost for joining. Advantages of joining a Compost Co-Op are you can drop off 24/7, you can take home finished compost,  and access to a community of fellow composters. 

## Step 1:  SOURCE
Find your local co-op. 

## Step 2:  COLLECT & DROP OFF
The fun part! Collect your household food scraps at home making sure you’re following the Accepted Materials Guidelines and any other instructions you received upon registration.  If you have any issues accessing or when at the site contact join@lacompost.org.

## Step 3:  SUPPORT YOUR CO-OP 
 Continue your co-op membership by volunteering at your co-op or at any other LA Compost volunteer opportunity. Visit the Volunteer Page for more information on volunteering.

How it Works: Community Hubs are shared spaces in gardens, schools, parks, places of worship and places of work. These hubs are available for food scrap drop off, compost education and hands on learning. There is no cost or requirement to join other than receiving the proper instructions from LA Compost and being a mindful and respectful steward of the space. Finished compost created at Community Compost Hubs will not be available for members to take home, it will be used onsite to create healthy soils and grow food. 


## STEP 2: COLLECT
The fun part! Collect your household food scraps at home making sure you’re following the compost hub guidelines. Visit the Compost FAQs page if you have any questions. Once you’re ready to drop off, visit your hub, weigh, record, and drop your scraps in the open bin. 

## STEP 3:  SUPPORT YOUR HUB
Each hub is a unique community ecosystem. Your individual hub will operate on its own calendar of volunteer events and compost pile turning days. When you join a hub you’ll receive info on how to best support your compost hub in addition to providing food scraps. You can also follow @lacompost on social media to stay up to date on special hub events.

LA Compost began in 2013 with the collective efforts of volunteers, friends and family. We wanted communities to see how far their organic material was traveling and the harmful effects it had on the environment. In the beginning, our collection crew rode bikes with trailers that allowed them to haul food scraps, leaves, paper, and other organic material from restaurants, homes, and schools to local compost centers. While this model has worked in other cities, LA’s sprawl made the pilot unsustainable.

In 2014, LA Compost shifted to a model of decentralized community compost hubs -cared for, maintained and enjoyed by activated community members. LA Compost hubs are built in places where people coexist -in churches, schools, gardens, and workplaces. We now have community compost hubs throughout LA County. Each hub reflects the community in which it''s located, but they all serve the same purpose. They compost organics locally while creating shared spaces for people to connect with each other and the natural world.

In 2018, we defined our scope according to the Hierarchy to Reduce Food Waste and Grow Community established by the Institute of Local Self Reliance. Our programs serve the individual for home composting, the community with access and education to a decentralized network of composting infrastrucutre, as well as regionally based sites for organics processing, compost creation, and continued education.

High efficiency washers use 20 to 66 percent less water than traditional agitator washers. Nearly 80 percent of the operating cost of a washer goes to heating water. Lower water use means less water to heat and energy use can be 20 to 50 percent less offering long-term savings and environmental benefits.

The latest innovation in sprinkler technology are nozzles that turn a standard pop-up spray head into a precision device that can save water in your landscape. In addition, water jetting from these nozzles is more resistant to wind, less
likely to mist, and significantly reduces run-off onto streets and sidewalks. 

These nozzles shoot multi-trajectory, rotating streams that apply water more slowly and uniformly than conventional sprays and heads especially when adjusted for specific site
conditions. Rotating nozzles use less water than traditional spray heads because they operate with lower precipitation rates and have greater distribution uniformity. In many cases, you can update your existing sprinkler heads with new rotary nozzles without having to replace the entire sprinkler body. Also, rotating nozzles have greater coverage.

Today, American lawns occupy some 30-40 million acres of land. Lawnmowers to maintain them account for some 5 percent of the nation’s air pollution – probably more in urban areas. Each year more than 17 million gallons of fuel are spilled during the refilling of lawn and garden equipment—more than the oil that the Exxon Valdez spilled.

Homeowners spend billions of dollars and typically use 10 times the amount of pesticide and fertilizers per acre on their lawns as farmers do on crops; the majority of these chemicals are wasted due to inappropriate timing and application. These chemicals then runoff and become a major source of water pollution.Last but not least, 30 to 60 percent of urban fresh water is used on lawns. Most of this water is also wasted due to poor timing and application. [Read More](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/06/04/the-problem-of-lawns)

The Waterworks Districts offer customers a rebate for removing water-inefficient grass with drought-tolerant landscaping. Please be advised that the rebate is not available until after completion of the drought conversion project. This means customers will not receive a rebate until after the project is completed and post-inspected. The Cash for Grass program has been a successful program and has removed over 2,000,000 square feet of inefficient turf and replaced it with drought-tolerant, efficient landscaping.

Smart irrigation systems are a combination of an advanced technology of sprinklers with nozzles that improve coverage and irrigation controllers that are watering and water conservation systems that monitor moisture-related conditions on your property and automatically adjust watering to optimal levels. Also known as ET-based technology, a weather-based irrigation system includes either a mini on-site weather station or weather sensor capable of monitoring conditions such as temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation on your property, or this same information is broadcast to the irrigation controller from a remote weather site. Up to 40 percent savings on water consumption when compared to traditional irrigation methods is not considered unusual.

As the first on- the-water MPA Watch program in California, and the only source of on-the-water data in Los Angeles, the program is critical to ensuring these precious habitats are protected and preserved for all to enjoy. 

While they will be operating this program primarily without volunteers, until it is safe to do so under evolving COVID-19 public health guidelines, MPA Watch typically bring more than 300 volunteers on board every year to collect critical data that helps improve management of these “underwater parks” and to provide once-in-a-lifetime experiences on the water. 

They are proud that this program promotes coastal access for students, underserved youth, volunteers and Angelenos of all stripes and look forward to reengaging volunteers to build long-term awareness and support of MPAs.

Despite the ecological and community importance of these areas, we continue to find litter and debris creating negative impacts. Trash poses a threat to human health, wildlife, and our environment. Trash that is allowed to enter our waters becomes marine debris, adding to the pollution problem facing the world. By participating in the Cleanup Challenge, you will positively impact communities and outdoor spaces up and down the watershed. Let’s take the time to care for our waterways!

Challenge sites are categorized into four groups: Coastal, River & Creeks, Metropolitan Parks, and Trails. Participants pick two sites from three categories of their choice to ensure cleanup efforts improve our watershed, help diverse communities, and protect our ocean. After the first cleanup, you have one year to complete SIX total cleanups and become a Cleanup Champion. Once you’ve finished the Challenge, you will receive a certificate of completion and fun prizes!

Through the Community Water Watch program (CWW), LA Water Keeper seeks to ensure that community members living in LA’s most impacted industrial areas have the tools, training, and resources to identify toxic runoff and hold polluters and regulators accountable.

While they will be operating this program primarily without volunteers, until it is safe to do so under evolving COVID-19 public health guidelines, they typically work with partners to train members of impacted communities in water quality sampling and identify the types of toxins flowing through their streets, educate their neighbors and family concerning water quality indicators, and use data collected to advocate for and support a healthier environment. Please sign up to express your interest in volunteering when community engagement with the program resumes.

LADWP is offering residential customers the opportunity to improve the energy and water performance in their homes, which can improve their comfort level and potentially reduce their energy and water cost through the Home Energy Improvement Program (HEIP). The program is free to eligible customers.

An assessment of your home will be performed by our trained technicians to assist you in identifying the most appropriate and effective improvements for your home. During your assessment, our trained technicians will identify the areas in your home where cost-effective energy efficient upgrades and repairs should be made to improve your home. The home report is then forwarded to our skilled repair technicians to complete the work and after a quality assurance review is made of your home to ensure that the work has been performed properly, you’re done!

## How to Apply

Interested customers must send a completed Home Energy Improvement Program Application.

Want a free tree for your yard or neighborhood? L.A.’s Green New Deal to plant 90,000 trees in the city over the next two years is a bonus for residents. The city will give out up to seven free yard and/or street trees to qualifying residents. More than two dozen species are listed on the city’s website, with information about their projected height and defining characteristics. Most are drought-tolerant.

Small trees include crape myrtles, which can grow to a height of 25 feet and have pink, red or white flowers. Medium trees include silk floss trees, which can reach 25 to 35 feet in height and have pink flowers; evergreen olive trees; and jacarandas, with their mesmerizing blue or lavender flowers. Jacarandas can grow to 50 feet high. Large trees, some of which can reach 80 feet tall, include coast live oaks, which are native to parts of L.A.; Canary Island, Italian stone and African fern pines; and deodar cedars, native to the Himalayas.

“A family can sit at their computer in their PJs, pick out a tree online and have it delivered to their yard,” said L.A.''s first forest officer, Rachel Malarich. “All the work is done for them up to the actual planting. But don’t worry. The trees come with stakes, ties and fertilizer pellets, along with easy-to-follow instructions on how to plant them.”Neighbors can get together and request free trees for their street on the City Plants website. “One of our nonprofit partners will come and assess the location,” Malarich said. “If it meets our criteria — enough space between the sidewalk and the road; no low overhead power lines — they will obtain the necessary city permits and plant the trees for them. The neighbors must sign an agreement to water them for at least the first five years.”

Residents who qualify for yard trees must also sign a commitment to water them. The first five years of a tree’s life are the most important. “If you don’t check once a week, the tree could either die or get stressed out and stop growing,” Malarich said. “If you get it past that point, you can slow down on the watering and enjoy your relationship to a living thing as you watch it grow.”

Malarich advises residents to check their tree once a week. “Before you start your weekend, or when you take out the trash, stick your finger in the soil and see if it’s moist 4 inches down,” she said. “If it’s dry, give it 10 to 15 gallons of water; if it’s moist, wait until next week. You can kill a baby tree by over-watering it.”

“Think of a tree as a baby,” Long Beach City College horticulture professor Jorge Ochoa said. “You need to feed it and invest time in training it to be the best it can be. If your baby grows up healthily, it will give you the pleasure and satisfaction of shade and beauty for many years.”

Biden’s advisors quickly identified the US Department of Agriculture as a “lynchpin” of any climate strategy. The president predicted that the United States would be the “first in the world” to achieve net-zero emissions from its ag sector, which currently accounts for an estimated tenth of total US emissions. And former and future Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack declared agriculture “the first and best place to begin getting some wins” on climate.

Annie Haigler steps out of her home in Louisville, Ky., pulling a handkerchief out of her pocket to dab sweat off her forehead. She enjoys sitting on her porch, especially to watch the sunrise. She has always been a morning person.

But as the day progresses, the heat can be unbearable for her. On summer days like this, when highs reach into the 90s, the lack of trees in her neighborhood is hard for Haigler to ignore.

"That''s what I''m accustomed to trees doing: They bring comfort. You don''t notice it, you don''t think about it. But they bring comfort to you," she says.

The tree cover in her neighborhood, Park DuValle, is about half the city average. As one of the lower-income areas of Louisville, it''s in line with a citywide trend: Wealthier areas of the city have up to twice as many trees as do poorer areas.

Trees can play a huge role in the health of people living in cities, but across the country, cities are losing millions of trees year after year. And many poor urban neighborhoods — often home to a city''s most vulnerable — are starting at a disadvantage.

Across North America and globally, governments have begun to acknowledge the importance of permeable surfaces.

Most towns and cities now actively incentivize the use of permeable surfaces in new public and private projects, and some have even begun to mandate the use of permeable paving products.

Landscape architects and Parks Department designers have long recognized the need for permeability, but lacked access to affordable and effective permeable paving products.

This has now changed with a wide range of permeable surfaces available, including permeable concrete, permeable asphalt and stabilizing aggregate binders, such as Organic-Lock™.

There is no better example of the push for permeable surfaces than China’s ‘Sponge City’ initiative.

In response to repeated problems of flooding, the Chinese government launched a program to increase the permeability of its urban developments to make their cities act like a ‘sponge’ and reduce the risk of flooding...

Gangstas to Growers is teaching life lessons through agriculture, and is reversing powerful, negative trends through the local food movement. 

Henderson’s vision brings together two important facets of the modern urban revival—the locavore food movement that has become a fixture of gentrifying cities across the country, and an awakening recognition that gentrification was leaving behind, or even displacing, a significant portion of the population. Simultaneously, Gangstas to Growers also teaches young people the importance of building wealth in historically disinvested communities in Atlanta. Despite Atlanta’s reputation as a Black Mecca, the city’s low-income children have less of a shot to move up the income ladder compared with other major American cities.

Although agave is a plant that grows prolifically in some of the harshest climates in the world, up until now this plant has been largely ignored, if not outright denigrated. Apart from producing alcoholic beverages, agaves are often considered a plant and livestock pest, along with its thorny, nitrogen-fixing, leguminous companion trees or shrubs such as mesquite and acacias.

But now, the development of a new agave-based agroforestry and holistic livestock management system in the semi-arid drylands of Guanajuato, Mexico, utilizing basic ecosystem restorations techniques, permaculture design, and silage production using anaerobic fermentation, is changing the image of agave and their companion trees. This agave-powered agroforestry and livestock management system is demonstrating that native plants, long overlooked, have the potential to regenerate the drylands, provide large amounts of inexpensive but essential forage for grazing animals, and alleviate rural poverty.

The Growing Home is a suburban demonstration project that, since 2011, has served as an educational center, model of sustainable living, and urban farm located in Diamond Bar, CA (suburbs of Los Angeles). The Growing Home seeks to inspire others to re-think, re-imagine, and re-generate the suburban landscape to build a green & sustainable future. Learn more about The Growing Home below, and check out upcoming classes, workshops, and free videos at The Growing Club website.

Why flush or water with drinking water? Installing a greywater system ultimately reduces your water bill as well as your high impact on a high footprint resource. Drinking water is a precious resource so use your dishwater, laundry water and other wastewater for your non-drinking system.

...Seaweed is able to absorb five times as much CO2 as land plants, and it can sequester nitrogen buildup in the water, as well as the harmful runoff from farming or human waste. It helps rebuild coastal ecosystems by creating a sanctuary for other types of marine life, and acts as a natural buffer to protect the coastline against storm surges (a more likely occurrence in the age of climate change). For all its benefits, it requires very little from its cultivators—no fertilizer, fresh water, or land—and grows quickly and cheaply.

Christopher Nyerges has worked with numerous organizations, schools, churches, and Scouting groups. He and his late wife Dolores started the School of Self-Reliance to continue their educational and publishing efforts. Christopher has always been driven by the desire to live a more self-reliant life-style, even in the city, and to share those lessons with those who wish to live likewise. Today, the school has evolved into teaching several dozen different classes and class-series, working with many highly-qualified teachers, reaching people of all ages and all walks of life.

Many of the skills that the School of Self Reliance teach are very basic, and would have been common knowledge a century ago.  Besides learning the skills and lifestyles of self-reliance, they encourage people to become an active and positive part of their societies.  They are not isolationists, but believe in working within the guidelines of existing society.

Rebates Start at $40
Rebates of $40 per toilet are available for Premium High Efficiency Toilets using 1.1 gallons per flush or less.

The largest amount of water used inside your home–about 30%–goes toward flushing the toilet. But how much water your toilet actually needs to flush properly is less than you think!

## How
Eligible toilets must replace existing toilets using 1.6 gallons per flush or more.

Premium high-efficiency toilets use almost 20% less water than the WaterSense standard and flush the same amount of waste just as, if not more effectively.

Water savings from high-efficiency toilets can save over $800 on your water bill over the lifetime of the product.

Combine these savings with SoCal Water$mart rebates and premium high-efficiency toilet upgrades can pay for themselves.

The qualifying premium high-efficiency models available for a rebate have been performance tested and certified through MaP testing. MaP testing is an independent testing program

A soil moisture sensor measures soil moisture content in the active root zone where it is installed on your property. The sensor is placed in a location that best represents the overall soil moisture condition of the site, and must be connected to an irrigation system controller that accepts a signal from the sensor. A measurement is taken before each scheduled irrigation event, and the irrigation controller bypasses the scheduled run cycle if the soil moisture is above a certain threshold as defined by the user.

## How to get one

SoCal Water$mart eligible soil moisture sensor systems (SMSS) must include a sensor and a calibrator (these are typically packaged together in the same device) and an irrigation controller. A sensor/calibrator can be added to an existing compatible irrigation controller, but the SMSS is not eligible for a rebate if the user has already received a rebate for a Weather Based Irrigation Controller. Rebates are not available for both the SMSS and a Weather Based Irrigation Controller if purchased together.

Low flow shower heads can decrease water consumption by 40% or more! This not only conserves water, but it cuts down on your monthly water bill providing significant end-of-year savings. Showers take energy to heat the water, thus cutting down on water usage also cuts down on energy usage. You can expect to save up to $50 annually on heating costs. It also cuts down on carbon dioxide emissions. Since the demand for hot water is lessened, the amount of energy used is lower and results in lower CO2 dispersed into the air.

The intent of the Turf Replacement program is to have homeowners remove their existing grass and to replace it with organic, drought tolerant landscaping. The Turf Replacement program aims to combine turf removal, irrigation modification and rainwater retention or filtration to support reuse or soil absorption of rainwater.

## How to get a rebate

The Turf Replacement program is a two-part application process. In order to receive a rebate, you must apply to reserve rebate funds prior to starting your project. After the reservation, you will have 180 days to complete the project and submit your request for a rebate. Metropolitan Water District is offering a rebate of $2.00 per square foot up to 5,000 square feet of converted yard per year.

Weather-based “Smart” Controllers for irrigation work on a simple principle: provide the appropriate watering schedule, adjust for weather changes and irrigate based on the needs of the landscape and soil conditions. A smart controller will automatically reduce the watering times as the weather gets cooler and less water is needed. Then as the weather begins to warm up, the controller will add more watering time. The way this typically works is that you set the controller for a default maximum watering time, based on the hottest time of year. Then the controller reduces that time amount by a percentage value when less water is needed.

There are a variety of weather-based “smart” controllers available for commercial applications. Whether it is real-time on-site weather data, off-site data with internet access, historical weather data or on-site monitoring, the new “smart” controllers leave little room for error.

Rebates Start at $35 per Barrel or $250 per Cistern

Collecting and re-using rainwater for lawns and gardens minimizes the amount of water flowing into your storm drains, sewer systems and local waterways. Plants and microbes prefer rainwater because it is naturally “soft” and free of chlorine, fluoride and other chemicals.

Applicants may not submit a rebate claim for both rain barrels and cisterns. Customers who purchase one or more rain barrels must submit for all eligible rain barrels on a single application. Submitting one application for the rain barrel(s) or cistern will prevent customers from receiving a rebate for any subsequent rain barrel or cistern purchase(s).

Because Rain Barrels are excluded from the CDRO (Contractor Direct Rebate Option), applications submitted must make the rebate payable to the water bill account holder, and the address listed on the application must match the installation address, or the mailing address on the water bill.

## Product
• Rain Barrel (50-199 gallons) (max. quantity: 2) Rebate $35.00

• Cistern (200-500 gallons) (max. quantity: 1) Rebate $250.00

• Cistern (501-999 gallons) (max. quantity: 1) Rebate $300.00

• Cistern (1000+ gallons) (max. quantity: 1) Rebate $350.00

If you have ever unscrewed the end of a kitchen or bathroom faucet or felt inside with your finger, you may have discovered a device with a small metal screen disk—a faucet aerator. The aerator is an important feature that both improves the physical operation of the faucet and enhances the experience of using the faucet. 

Removing the aerator and tapping it out upside-down may release a small piece of grit or scale produced by the inside of the pipes. While an aerator does filter debris, this is not its main purpose. Rather, a faucet aerator improves the flow of water and helps it feel softer to the touch. By introducing small bubbles to the water, the faucet aerator allows the faucet to run longer while using less water.

A duct system that is well-designed and properly sealed can make your home more comfortable, energy efficient, and safer. Energy used in our homes often comes from the burning of fossil fuels at power plants, which contributes to smog, acid rain, and climate change. Simply put, the less energy we use in our homes, the less air pollution we generate. By sealing your ducts and reducing the amount of energy necessary to comfortably heat or cool your home, you can reduce the amount of air pollution generated.

Heat pump water heaters use electricity to move heat from one place to another rather than generating their own heat like a traditional electric water heater. This makes them two to three times more efficient, according to the Department of Energy (DOE). If every household in the United States used a heat pump water heater (under 55 gallons), the energy cost savings would top $8.2 billion dollars a year, according to Energy Star. A heat pump water heater can save your household of four people around $330 a year on your electric bill, according to the government website Energy Star. That adds up to a savings of around $3,400 over the life of a typical heat pump water heater.

One inch of rain falling on the roof of an average sized single family home can generate over 1,200 gallons of runoff.

The health of our soil resource has declined to such a point that it is not only negatively affecting farm and ranch profitability, but it is also having a devastating impact on everything from our water quality to our communities and even to our health. North Dakota rancher Gabe Brown walks us through a common sense solution to this crisis.

Gabe Brown is one of the pioneers of the current soil health movement that focuses on regenerating our resources. Gabe, along with his wife, Shelly, and son, Paul, own and operate a diversified 5,000-acre farm and ranch near Bismarck, ND. Their operation focuses on farming and ranching in nature’s image.

The Browns holistically integrate their grazing and no-till cropping systems, which include a wide variety of cash crops, multi-species cover crops along with all natural grass finished beef and lamb. They also raise pastured laying hens, broilers and swine. This diversity and integration has regenerated the natural resources on the ranch without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides.

This Free Online Permaculture Course will help you grow your own food and design a home system that can thrive with nature….even if you don’t own your land or have a lot of money.

**Earth Care, People Care, Future Care**
Most permaculture courses focus on landscape design but don’t do much to help you gain access to land or navigate the complex social circumstances that surround any attempt at sustainable or regenerative living.
 
​Permaculture has three ethics, not just one, and if you don’t include social relationships in your design approach, you’re sure to have some serious problems.

All of our permaculture design courses, no matter how big or small, make sure you get the balanced permaculture training you need to face not just challenges in the garden, but also larger issues in your interconnected community.

The clothes we wash and wear each week might seem 
unconnected to the growing plastic pollution crisis in our oceans but a sobering truth is emerging. With each wash, synthetic fabrics shed thousands of plastic particles, leading to broad-scale contamination of waterways. Doing the laundry has other environmental implications, too, from the water and power used to the harmful substances hidden in common detergents. A more natural approach to laundry is crucial for the health of humans and the planet, so consider our practical steps on how to make the switch.

Barcelona has contributed €30,000 (£26,000) towards the cost of solar energy pavement, the remainder being met by the manufacturer. The viability of the scheme will be assessed after six months. “We’ll have to assess the wear and tear because obviously it’s not the same as putting panels on a roof, although they are highly resistant,” says Eloi Badia, who is responsible for climate emergency and ecological transition at Barcelona city council.

The 6.5 acre Japanese Garden is adjacent to the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant. The basic engineering concept was to build an attractive "upstream" facility for removing 95% of the water from sewage, which would relieve demand on the "downstream" main Hyperion facility in Playa del Rey and forestall the necessity of building another mainline sewage tunnel through the Valley. The other 5% of the water would be used to carry biosolids down to Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant where they would be processed to generate electricity. 

The Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant interfaces with the public through a Japanese Garden with a theme of the peaceful, beautiful uses of water.

Every year, homeowners across the country arm themselves for battle and prepare for war. The battlefront is their lawns and gardens. The weapon of choice is an array of chemical pesticides. There’s another way to engage this persistent enemy. Instead of turning garden storage areas into an armory stockpiled and resupplied with chemical pesticides, the battle can be fought in a more environmentally friendly way. A bonus is that the cost of the battle can be paid for with a song. Landscapes filled with plants or other attractants that invite bug-eating birds, many of them songbirds, to your yard can go a long way to controlling troublesome insect populations.

TreePeople got its name because its founder, Andy Lipkis, recognized the interconnectedness between trees and people. 

We need each other to thrive in Los Angeles and we’ve made it our mission to care and fight for both.

That’s why a major factor of the work we do is improving equity in LA. We believe that people of all socioeconomic backgrounds have a right to beautiful green spaces, which have been proven to improve both mental and physical health.

In this episode of *What The Hal?*, Hal Eisner speaks with Andy Lipkis, who started TreePeople in Los Angeles. 

He''s dedicated his life to healing the environment while improving the lives of individuals and communities.  Also on the show is Bryan Rekart, Director of Forestry for TreePeople.

TreePeople is an environmental nonprofit organization whose mission is to inspire, engage and support people to take personal responsibility for the urban environment, making it safe, healthy, fun and sustainable and to share our process as a model for the world.

In cities throughout Los Angeles, where extreme heat marks the summer seasons, trees are a key component in creating safer, more comfortable neighborhoods. 

That’s why we’re so happy to see citizens taking the initiative to fill in the gaps in spaces that need these trees.

Take Holmby-Westwood, for example, where citizen foresters took it upon themselves to organize with us and create the beautiful green spaces they deserve. Their incredible project will include 300 trees and will take up to 10 years to complete.

The effects of trees are multifold – they increase home values (A tree placed in front of a home will boost property values by an average of $7,000), mitigate the urban heat island effect, protect vulnerable populations from the sun, reduce utility bills, and much more.

It may come as a surprise that TreePeople doesn’t plant trees in neighborhoods. Instead, we engage communities and support the process of planting trees in neighborhoods. We provide tools, advice, and guidance, but at the end of the day, it’s up to the Angelenos who take on these projects to get them done.

We believe that community organizing is key to creating lasting change because there are too many trees in LA for one organization to care for; it’s up to locals of every neighborhood to maintain their homes and support the greater tree canopy.

Weeds. Love ‘em or hate ‘em they are hard to ignore – whether they are producing lovely flowers or taking over the garden!

**What really is a weed?**
Basically, it is a plant growing where you don’t want it to grow.  When caring for your low-water use, climate-appropriate garden, weeds can overtake a garden (especially after a good season of rain) competing with your plants for water, nutrients, light and dominating the space.  

At first, they seem harmless. However, left to grow, they continue to spread their seeds each year and can take over your sustainable landscape.

WaterTalks is a public program designed to generate and increase community involvement in planning a sustainable water future for California.   Its goal is to explore the strengths and opportunities of 128 communities in the Los Angeles and Ventura counties facing ongoing economic and environmental distress, and to gather input to prioritize and recommend water-related projects based on issues of greatest concern.  

WaterTalks aims to ensure that regional water resource management considers the health, safety, welfare, and resiliency of lower-income community members.

Land use directly affects how water moves through communities
Land use in urban communities ranges from open space and agriculture to varying levels of development. Developed land often consists of impervious surfaces, such as asphalt and concrete.

When land is paved, water is not able to soak into the ground. Too much water flowing across the hardened landscape can result in flooding and/or erosion. Water that flows over the hardened landscape is lost to the oceans and streams when it is directed into the storm drain systems that lead directly into rivers and oceans.

This untreated water is called urban runoff. Urban runoff, carrying pollutants such as automotive fluids, trash and pesticides, is the biggest source of pollution in our rivers and ocean.
Harvesting rainwater offers many benefits for communities. Capturing rainwater not only helps keep our waterways and ocean clean, but helps to replenish our groundwater supply and reduce our dependence on imported water.

Potential strategies for catching and storing water include creating rain gardens, bioswales, bioretention ponds; protecting open space; removing hardscape; and redirecting rainwater that falls on rooftops and parking lots into large tanks (cisterns) where it can be stored for later use.

These various methods function to keep our waterways and ocean clean, and help replenish our groundwater supply and reduce our dependence on imported water. Additionally, sustainable landscaping and irrigation practices can reduce and treat urban runoff while also conserving water.

Planting trees near your home has many advantages, and one of the most important is to provide shade from the sun. When placed in the right spots, trees can help cool your home, which helps lower utility costs, and they can protect your home from nature''s other elements, including rain and wind. Another advantage of larger trees could be to provide a sound barrier if you live in an area that''s near traffic or other disturbing noises. No matter what your needs, you will need to know how to choose where to plant trees in order to reap the most benefits.

Research shows that nature-based solutions (also sometimes called “natural” or “green” infrastructure) such as trees, wetlands, parks, open spaces and green roofs can address many of these problems at once. Nature-based solutions serve as multi-benefit infrastructure that meet core community needs while also providing co-benefits. Trees and other plants generate oxygen, aid with carbon sequestration and can mitigate other air pollution, while shading streets and parks, providing wildlife habitat, absorbing rainfall, slowing runoff, boosting mental health and more.
