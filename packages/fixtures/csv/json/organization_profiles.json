Or any other niche in the big, wide, wonderful world of bikes.\n\nIt’s about bicycling. Period.\n\nIt’s about the latest bike news. It’s about advocacy, and making our streets safe for people on bicycles. It’s about honoring fallen cyclists, and doing what we can to ensure it never happens again. And looking past the usual victim blaming to see events from a bike rider’s perspective.\n\nAs the name implies, it’s about bicycling in Los Angeles, and throughout Southern California. And anywhere else bikes happen to make the news.\n\nIt was born as a bike blog, and gradually transformed into Southern California’s leading source for bike news and advocacy. You can still read the older posts in the archives, or check out the highlights on the Best page",
